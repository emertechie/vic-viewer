# Project Overview

## Summary

A modern, fast, React app to view logs, traces (and eventually metrics) that are stored in a [VictoriaMetrics](victoriametrics.com) stack using VictoriaLogs, VictoriaTraces, and VictoriaMetrics.

This project is built to provide a better developer experience than existing user interfaces, with strong focus on clarity, speed, and day-to-day usability.

## Why This Exists

Existing tools can be powerful but often feel clunky for common workflows. This project is intended to deliver:

- Better UI and UX for exploration and debugging
- Fast local feedback loops

## Phase 1 (Current Focus)

- Viewing logs only
- Run locally for local app/service debugging
- Focus on viewing OpenTelemetry logs generated by .Net apps

## Phase 2

- Viewing traces
- Again, focusing on running locally

## Later Phases

- Add metric support
- Production deployment
